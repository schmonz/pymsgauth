Using pymsgauth

   To use pymsgauth effectively, do the following:

  Installing pymsgauth

     * Download the latest version of pymsgauth.
     * Unpack the tarball.
     * Create and populate the directories.

 mkdir -m 755 /usr/lib/pymsgauth and /usr/doc/pymsgauth
 install -m 755 pymsgauth.py ConfParser.py pymsgauth-mail pymsgauth-confirm pymsgauth-clean /usr/lib/pymsgauth
 install -m 644 pymsgauth.html pymsgauth.txt pymsgauthrc-example CHANGELOG BUGS COPYING /usr/doc/pymsgauth
                        

     * Symlink the commands into /usr/bin

 cd /usr/bin
 ln -s ../lib/pymsgauth/pymsgauth-* ./
                        

  Configuring pymsgauth

     * Create a local configuration/data directory. The default is
       ~/.pymsgauth, but can be overridden in the environment variable
       PYMSGAUTH_DIR.

 mkdir m 700 ~/.pymsgauth
                        

     * Create a configuration file pymsgauthrc in the above directory.
       Examine the provided pymsgauthrc-example file for details.

  Configuring qmail delivery

     * Configure qmail to process messages from qsecretary-protected mailing
       lists. For instance, if mail from the qmail mailing list is controlled
       by ~/.qmail-list, edit that file. Include a delivery to the
       pymsgauth-confirm command before your Maildir or mbox delivery line,
       as follows:

 |/usr/bin/pymsgauth-confirm
 ./Mail/list/
                        

  Configuring MUAs

     * Configure your MUA to use pymsgauth-mail as its sendmail interface. In
       mutt, this means setting sendmail to the path to pymsgauth-mail in
       your .muttrc file.

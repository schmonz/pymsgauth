Version 2.1.0
14 December 2003

  -make change to the way the mail command is passed to the popen2.Popen3()
  constructor to eliminate a potential security problem exploitable only by
  djb.  Much thanks to Paul Jarc for noticing and reporting this.
  -the above change means that the 'mail_prog' and 'extra_mail_args' configuration
  values must now be lists instead of a simple string; if you've customized
  these values in your ~/.pymsgauth/pymsgauthrc file, check that they use the
  new format.

Version 2.0.0
19 March 2003

  -fix under later BSDs.  Thanks to Karsten W. Rohrbach for a patch changing
  the popen2 command handling.
